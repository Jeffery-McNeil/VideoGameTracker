This is a video game tracker web app built with React.  Styling was done with CSS.

Video game tracker uses the RAWG API to populate a video game search request.  

This web app has three routes built with React's client side routing: 

  1) Home Page - Intro to web app and the functionality it provides
  2) Explore Page - automatically render 12 random video game cards, can load 12 more random cards, search for all relevent entries to keyword typed, and sort cards
  3) My Lists Page - create a specific backlog of video game cards from 3 different categories and move cards to different categories depending on gaming status
